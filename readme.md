# Kitchen Novice Secrets

### Kitchen Novice Secrets is an online cookbook meant for beginner bakers and aspiring chefs. Each section showcases various recipes of various difficulties, helping the user try out new dishes, improve their cooking techniques, and rise to a higher skill level! Every recipe also allows the user to choose how many servings they would like to make, each quantity leading to a separate and specific recipe for the cooker to use. To make it more engaging, our website also features quizzes! In these quizzes, the user gets to find out what food represents their personality, or maybe even what exotic recipe they must try based on their tastes!

### JS will be used in identifying how many servings the cooker wants the recipe to provide and outputing results in quizzes. The initial tests can be found in the Beef Recipes and Quizzes menu.
